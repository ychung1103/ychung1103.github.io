TITLE  Chapter 4 Exercise 4                (ch04_04.asm)

Comment !
Description: Write a program that uses addition and subtraction
to set and clear the Overflow flag. After each addition or
subtraction instruction, insert the call DumpRegs statement
to display the registers and flags. Using comments, explain how
(and why) the Overflow flag was affected by each instruction.
Optional: include an ADD instruction that sets both the Carry
and Overflow flags.
